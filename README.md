# Cancer_Death_Rate
I have used the Regression technique to build a machine learning model that predicts the cancer death rate for a given year.
Employed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. Also,
utilised BorutaPy for feature selection.
